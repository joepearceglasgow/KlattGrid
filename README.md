# KlattGrid
A selection of Praat scripts to make changes to various voice quality parameters in KlattGrid.

These materials were initially created as part of my research on the contribution of voice quality to gender perception, and were presented in their current form at BAAP 2022. KlattGrid.pdf contains the instructions for playing around with KlattGrid to synthesize voice quality differences.
